# Report on Language Creation Assigment.

As part of our language creation Assigment. 
During the review, our mentor pointed out that most of our work focused on typography rather than developing a truly new language. 
He explained that modifying the existing 26 English letters and assigning different interpretations was not the right approach. 

Instead, a new language should have its own unique set of symbols and tokens with meanings. 
This feedback helped us to rethink our approach and focus on creating a more original and meaningful language.

moving on
Today, we also revisited all the topics covered so far in the internship. 
 we have developed several fundamental skills that are essential for both personal and professional growth.
# Skills.
Problem-solving: Strengthening logical thinking and structured approaches.
Teamwork: Learning how to collaborate effectively on projects.
Compounding: Understanding how knowledge builds over time through incremental learning.
Mathematical Thinking: Applying logic and quantitative reasoning to problem-solving.
 
# Technical Concepts Covered:

Git: Using version control to track and manage code changes.
Compilers: Understanding how high-level code is translated into machine-readable instructions.
Problem Classification: Identifying different types of computational problems and their solutions.

# Compiler Concepts
When working with compilers, we covered three major stages of code processing:

Tokenization: Breaking code into small, meaningful units called tokens.
Syntax Analysis: Ensuring the structure of code follows the correct language rules.
Semantic Analysis: Checking whether the code makes logical sense and functions as intended.

### Today we moved in dept of understand Data & it's types
# Understanding Data
Data is everywhere—it forms the foundation of information. But what exactly is data?

At its core, Data is everything in our lives, consisting of facts, become meaningful information. 

It can be categorized into two types:

Variable Data: Words or values that can have different meanings depending on context. For example, "space" could refer to the universe or a punctuation character.
Constant Data: Words or values with fixed meanings that do not change.


### Programming languages are built on a few essential components:

Symbols: Basic elements like mathematical operators (+, -), alphabets (a-z), and numbers (0-9).
Tokens: Combinations of symbols that form meaningful elements, such as "hello" or the number 100.
Expressions: Statements that combine tokens, such as a + b = 10. In this case, all elements are symbols except 10, which is a token.
Keywords: Reserved words in a programming language that have predefined meanings, such as let, for, if, and var.
Data Types in Programming
Every piece of data in a program has a specific type. These types fall into two main categories:

Primitive Data Types: Basic types like strings, booleans, integers, numbers, and floats.
Complex Data Types: More advanced structures like arrays, maps, and objects.
Variables and Data Storage
In programming, variables are used to store data. For example:

 
let value = true;
Here, value is a variable that stores a Boolean (true).

## Understanding Variable Declaration
Let’s break down this statement:

let markAge = 22;
let (Keyword): Declares a variable.
markAge (Variable Name): A meaningful name representing Mark’s age.
= (Assignment Operator): Assigns a value to the variable.
22 (Value): The actual data being stored.
; (Sentence Terminator): Indicates the end of the statement.

Mentor.

I've completed my Figma design and, in the process
gained a proper understanding of design concepts like font selection, spacing, padding, colors and overall UI readability. 

With that foundation, I’ve shifted my focus back to Angular basics.
So far, I’ve refreshed my knowledge on adding components, linking them properly to the .html files, and ensuring that I’m working in the right .ts files instead of mistakenly modifying the spec.ts files.

Moving forward, my mentor has asked me to learn control flow statements in Angular 17+, 
such as @if, @for, and @switch, to explore what all can be used within HTML templates. 

@if – A more useful alternative to *ngIf. This allows for better readability and scope control within templates.
implemented @if, in a previous increment and decrement button, to display text after some number .
