## Figma
Today, I learned more about Figma design patterns, particularly focusing on the importance of font, padding, spacing between words and letters, and how these elements impact the overall design and readability of a UI. Understanding these details is crucial for creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. Proper spacing helps produce a pleasing user experience, making it easier to navigate a webpage.

Key Takeaways
Today's Figma learnings help in creating clean, structured UI designs, not only providing users with a good UI (interface) but also a great UX (experience).

## Angular
I also began learning Angular, a powerful framework for building dynamic web applications.
Today, we focused on understanding Angular's file structure, including key files like:

Component folder – Contains individual UI components that help modularize the project.
App folder – Serves as the core part of the Angular application, managing configurations and main components.
SRC folder – Houses the main source files of the project, including styles, assets, and components.
index.html – Displays the output by receiving input through the <app-root> tag.
I also learned that when a variable is declared globally and needs to be used in a function, we must call it using the "this" keyword.
For example: this.num is used to reference the global variable num.

## Session 2: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
In the second session, we covered the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML (Skeleton) – Provides the structure, like bones in a body. It defines the layout and elements of a webpage.
CSS (Skin) – Styles and beautifies the page, just like skin and clothes enhance a person's appearance.
JavaScript (Brains) – Adds interactivity and functionality, making the webpage dynamic and responsive, just like a brain controls actions.
The focus was on:
HTML Basics – Learning essential tags such as <a> (used for links with href="..."), <p>, <span> (used for inline styling), and layout structures like Flexbox, Grid, and columns for responsive designs.
CSS Basic Styling – Understanding how to apply styles using colors, margins, padding, and font properties to enhance the visual appeal of webpages.
JavaScript Introduction – Not deeply covered, but we briefly touched on its role.
Flexbox vs. Grid
Use Flexbox when you need to line things up in a row or column.
Use Grid when designing a full-page layout with multiple sections.
When applying styles, it's best to use percentage (%) or rem instead of px to ensure the website remains responsive across different devices, including mobile.

Key Takeaways
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the backbone of web development, with Flexbox and Grid being essential for layout management.
CSS styling plays a key role in improving the aesthetics of a webpage.
