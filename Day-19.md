## Learned about @Input and @Output in Angular

In Angular, `@Input` and `@Output` are used for communication between parent and child components.

### @Input
Allows a parent component to pass data to a child component.

```typescript
import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<p>Received: {{ data }}</p>`
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Input() data!: string;
}
```

### @Output
Enables a child component to emit events to its parent component.

**Example:**

```typescript
import { Component, Output, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<button (click)="sendData()">Send Data</button>`
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Output() notify = new EventEmitter<string>();

  sendData() {
    this.notify.emit('Hello from Child!');
  }
}
```

## API Integration in Angular using HTTP

Angular provides the `HttpClientModule` for making API requests. Steps to integrate APIs include:

### Importing HttpClientModule

```typescript
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

@NgModule({
  imports: [HttpClientModule]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

## Conclusion
- `@Input` and `@Output` are essential for component communication.
- API integration in Angular is done using `HttpClientModule` with `HttpClient`.
- Observables are used to handle asynchronous data from APIs.

# Understanding Memory Allocation in Programming

Understanding how values are assigned to variables in memory is fundamental in programming. 
When dealing with normal variables, changing their values results in a change in their memory address. 

However, for lists and objects, the memory address remains unchanged even when values are modified.

## Variable Assignment and Memory Address Changes

For example:  

```
a = 10  
b = a  
print(b)  # Output: 10  
a = 30  # Address changes  
print(b)  # Still 10  
```

In contrast, lists maintain the same address even when modified:

```
list1 = [1, 2, 3]  
list2 = list1  
list1.append(4)  
print(list2)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]  
```

This demonstrates that lists are mutable and referenced in memory, meaning modifications affect all references to the same object.

## Key Takeaways

Previously, I had a general understanding of programming workflows, but delving into memory allocation and addressing has deepened my comprehension of computing principles. These foundational concepts are enhancing my programming skills, and I look forward to further exploration in this field.
