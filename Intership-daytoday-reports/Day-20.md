# Day 20  - Session on responsbility by askin.

We got a speech about taking responsibility and ownership of our lives and doing something with it.  

Mr. Askin, the first employee at Surfboard, 
led the session on responsibility and ownership of our lives, as well as the role of AI. 

He explained when and why to use AI while also warning us about the importance of being proactive in learning new things. 
He highlighted that relying too much on AI can make us lazy and hinder our ability to think critically.  

Instead of always turning to AI, he encouraged us to refer to documentation, as it provides a deeper understanding of concepts. 
AI, on the other hand, only gives direct answers, which may not always be correct or the best approach. I used to trust AI blindly, but now I’ve learned to use it effectively—only for specific doubts that documentation doesn’t address—while ensuring I truly understand what I’m searching for.  

He also emphasized the importance of responsibility. 
Learning, adapting to software development, and taking ownership of our growth are crucial. His speech served as a strong motivation, reminding me of why I joined and what I aim to achieve. It reinforced the idea that responsibility drives success, pushing us to take charge of our learning and career development.  

We received an inspiring speech about taking responsibility and owning our lives—not just going through the motions but actively doing something meaningful with them. The message was clear: success comes when we take charge of our actions, decisions, and growth.  

It reminded us that responsibility isn’t just about completing tasks—it’s about learning, improving, and making an impact. Instead of waiting for opportunities, we should create them. Instead of relying on external factors, we should take ownership of our progress. This perspective shift encouraged us to be proactive, embrace challenges, and shape our future with purpose.
