Today, I reported to my mentor about everything I learned the past week.

My mentor then asked me to work on topics I had studied and also focus on concepts that real software engineers use.

Like **FormControl and FormBuilder** in Angular, as well as **@Input and @Output** decorators.

As a hands-on exercise, I was asked to build a counter app that involved:

- Using FormControl and FormBuilder for handling form inputs.

- Implementing @Input and @Output to pass values between parent and child components.

- Understanding the process of passing data from parent to child and vice versa in Angular.
