Today, I learnt more of Angular directives and routing. 
These are fundamental concepts in Angular that enhance the functionality and navigation of webpages seemslessly.

**Angular Directives**

Directives in Angular are tools that allow developers to extend HTML with additional behavior. 

Structural Directives – These directives modify the DOM structure. 
I worked with:

*ngIf: Used for conditionally displaying elements.
*ngFor: Used for iterating over a collection.
*ngSwitch: Helps display different elements based on a condition.

Attribute Directives – change the appearance or behavior of an element. ngClass & ngStyle.
Custom Directives –  to manipulate elements dynamically.

**Angular Routing**
Routing in Angular is very necessary for building single-page applications (SPAs) . Today, I worked with:

- Setting Up Routes: I defined routes in app-routing.module.ts and used the RouterModule to manage navigation.
- RouterOutlet: Implemented <router-outlet> to display components on to the screen through app.html .

* Used routerLink for template-based navigation.
* Used routerActive to identify which page is beeing used or ddisplayed


Key Takeaways:-
Directives help in dynamically manipulating HTML elements, making the UI more interactive.
Routing allows seamless navigation within an Angular application.

using this knowledge i created a small navigation webpage , which includes Header-Component, which is displayed always;
welcome, login, About , and contact component which can be navigated through header.
And a page not found page when url is changed .

Session 2.
In our second session, we learned about:

 * Conditional Statements: This includes both if/else statements and switch statements.
 * For Loop: The for loop is comprised of initiation, condition, and iteration. eg. for(i=0;i>=10;i++)
 * JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): JSON is how data is transferred to and from the backend. The backend receives data in JSON format.
