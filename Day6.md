# Introduction

## Mathematical Representations

Let's consider two statements p & q.

1. **Logical Conjunction (AND)** p∧q - True if both p & q are true, otherwise false.
2. **Logical Disjunction (OR)** p∨q - True if at least one of p & q is true.
3. **Negation (NOT)** ¬p - Reverses the truth value of the statement. If p is true, ¬p is false, and vice versa.
4. **Implication (Conditional)** p→q - If one thing happens, then another thing follows.
5. **Biconditional (If and Only If)** p↔q - True if both p & q have the same truth value (both true or both false). If & only If p is true, then only q can be true also.

### Truth Tables

#### 1. Logical Conjunction (AND)

| p | q | p∧q |
|---|---|---|
| T | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| F | T | F |
| F | F | F |

#### 2. Logical Disjunction (OR)

| p | q | p∨q |
|---|---|---|
| T | T | T |
| T | F | T |
| F | T | T |
| F | F | F |

#### 3. Negation (NOT)

| p | ¬p |
|---|---|
| T | F |
| F | T |

#### 4. Implication (Conditional)

| p | q | p→q |
|---|---|---|
| T | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| F | T | T |
| F | F | T |

### In Implication, regardless of the statement "p", if "q" is true then implication is also true.
but if "q" is false , then then implication is also false.

#### 5. Biconditional (If and Only If)

| p | q | p↔q |
|---|---|---|
| T | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| F | T | F |
| F | F | T |

### In biconditional the statement is true if and only if both p and q have the same truth value —either both are true or both are false.

## Mentorship
**Mentor:** Joel

We discussed how development works at Surfboard, where **Flutter** and **JavaScript** are the primary technologies used.
How AI works?
AI works by analyzing past data, identifying features , characteristics or patterns and making recommendations based on that information.

### How AI Enhances Surfboard Apps
AI in Surfboard apps personalizes the user experience by analyzing behavior and preferences.

- **Recommendations based on previous purchases**
  - Example: Mark buys lightweight, airy shirts. AI can analyze and recommend similar clothing based on material, design, and structure.
  
- **Ads based on previous purchases**
  - Example: If Mark buys Marvel-branded clothes, AI can notify him when a new Marvel movie or series is released and display relevant ads.
  
This approach increases profits and creates a memorable experience for customers.
thats how AI can help.

## Flutter AI Integration
Enhance Flutter apps with AI for:
- Image Recognition (e.g., Camera can be used to identify products and add to cart )
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) (e.g., Predictive text, grammar correction : help with searching products)
- Predictive Analytics (e.g., AI-driven recommendations)

### Key AI Tools & Examples

#### TensorFlow Lite
- Multi-platform support (Android, iOS, macOS, Linux)
- Best for large-scale deployment

#### PyTorch Mobile
- Supports only mobile applications
- Best for research and prototyping

**Conclusion:** Since Surfboard has a large user base and requires cross-platform support, TensorFlow is the best choice for production-ready applications.

## Vertex AI
### Latest Gemini Models from Google

**Vertex AI** is a machine learning (ML) platform that helps build, deploy, and manage AI models. With Vertex AI, you can:
- Manage datasets with AutoML models for predictions

## Conclusion
Today's discussion focused on **how to think and brainstorm ideas independently** rather than relying entirely on AI. 
We explored AI applications in Flutter development and how reviewing multiple resources can provide broader insights rather than compressing everything into a single AI-generated response.
