**Learning Report on Angular Component Communication, Pipes, and Firebase Integration**

### Introduction
Over the past few days, I have dived deeper into Angular and expanded my knowledge on several key topics. 
I explored component communication using `@Input` and `@Output`, learned about Angular pipes including custom pipes, a
nd tried began integrating Firebase into an Angular project.

### Component Communication in Angular

One of the essential concepts in Angular is component communication, which is importanrt when working with complex applications that have multiple components. 
I focused on passing data between a parent and child component using `@Input` and `@Output` decorators.

#### `@Input` and `@Output` Implementation
I created a simple application where a parent component sends data to a child component, and vice versa, through button clicks. Here's how I approached it:

1. **Using `@Input` to Pass Data from Parent to Child:**
   - In the parent component, I declared a property to store the data to be passed.
   - In the child component, I used the `@Input` decorator to receive the data from the parent.
   - I then displayed the received data in the child component template.

2. **Using `@Output` to Pass Data from Child to Parent:**
   - In the child component, I declared an `EventEmitter` property decorated with `@Output`.
   - When a button was clicked, the event emitted data back to the parent component.
   - The parent component listened for the event and updated its properties accordingly.

This hands-on exercise helped me understand communication  between components in Angular.

### Exploring Angular Pipes

Pipes in Angular are used to transform displayed data dynamically. I explored built-in pipes like `uppercase`, `lowercase`, and `currency`, and also created a custom pipe to enhance my understanding.

#### Built-in Pipes
- **Uppercase & Lowercase:**
  - These pipes helped convert text case dynamically without modifying the actual data.
  - Example: `{{ 'hello world' | uppercase }}` → `HELLO WORLD`

- **Title Case Pipe:**
  - Although Angular does not have a built-in title case pipe, I learned to create one manually.
  - Example: `"hello world"` → `"Hello World"`

- **Currency Pipe:**
  - This pipe automatically formatted numbers into currency format based on the given locale.
  - Example: `{{ 1000 | currency:'USD':'symbol' }}` → `$1,000.00`

#### Creating a Custom Pipe
To deepen my understanding, I implemented a custom pipe that converts any text to title case. Here’s how I did it:

1. Created a new pipe using Angular CLI:
   ```sh
   ng generate pipe titlecase
   ```
2. Implemented the transformation logic in `transform()`:
   ```typescript
   import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

   @Pipe({
     name: 'titlecase'
   })
   export class TitlecasePipe implements PipeTransform {
     transform(value: string): string {
       return value.replace(/\b\w/g, char => char.toUpperCase());
     }
   }
   ```
3. Used it in the template:
   ```html
   <p>{{ 'angular pipes are powerful' | titlecase }}</p>
   ```
   - Output: *Angular Pipes Are Powerful*

This custom pipe implementation reinforced how flexible Angular's pipe system can be when dealing with different data transformation needs.

### Firebase Integration in Angular

Firebase is a backend-as-a-service platform that provides authentication, real-time database, cloud functions, and more. I started learning about Firebase, created a project on Firebase Console, and integrated it into my Angular application.

#### Steps I Followed:
1. **Setting up Firebase:**
   - I created a new Firebase project via the Firebase Console.
   - Configured the project and retrieved the Firebase configuration details.

2. **Integrating Firebase in Angular:**
   - Installed Firebase and AngularFire using npm:
     ```sh
     npm install firebase @angular/fire
     ```
   - Added Firebase configuration details in the `environment.ts` file.
   - Initialized Firebase in `app.module.ts`:
     ```typescript
     import { provideFirebaseApp, initializeApp } from '@angular/fire/app';
     import { provideAuth, getAuth } from '@angular/fire/auth';

     @NgModule({
       imports: [
         provideFirebaseApp(() => initializeApp(environment.firebaseConfig)),
         provideAuth(() => getAuth()),
       ]
     })
     export class AppModule {}
     ```

3. **Using Firebase Authentication:**
   - Implemented basic authentication (Sign-up and Sign-in) using Firebase Authentication.
   - Used AngularFireAuth service to manage user authentication.
   - Created a simple login form that interacted with Firebase Authentication.

Through this process, I gained a better understanding of how Firebase can be used as a backend for Angular applications, making authentication and database management easier.

### Challenges Faced and Solutions
. **Firebase Authentication Setup:**
   - I faced an issue where Firebase authentication was not working due to missing configurations in `app.module.ts`. I resolved it by carefully rechecking and correctly initializing Firebase services.
