Variable Declaration in TypeScript. with data-type.
name!: string;
The ! (definite assignment assertion) tells TypeScript that name will be assigned before use.
Later, inside a function, you can assign a value:
this.name = "Mark";


Unicode Standard

Core JavaScript Concepts
Array: An ordered list of values.
Object: A collection of key-value pairs.
Function: Can be declared and then called.
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, Mark!");
}
greet();


Typed vs. Untyped Languages
Typed languages (like TypeScript) require variables to have a defined type.
Untyped languages (like JavaScript) do not enforce type checking.


Compilation Errors vs. Runtime Errors
Compilation Errors (e.g., TypeScript) prevent incorrect code from running.
Runtime Errors occur when the compiler allows the code but it fails when executed.

Typed languages help manage large codebases by catching errors early.
