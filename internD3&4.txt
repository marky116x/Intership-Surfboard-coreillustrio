Internship Report - Day 3 & 4

Day 3 
- We reviewed our internship reports and learned how to write them properly.  

Day 4.

Propositions: Statements That Can Be True or False

 Examples of True Propositions:
"The sky is blue." (True)
"2 + 2 = 4." (True) 
Examples of False Propositions:
"The Earth is flat." (False)
"5 is greater than 10." (False) 

Why Learn About Propositions?
In programming, we use Boolean statements, which follow the same concept as propositions.

What Are Boolean Statements?
Boolean statements are expressions that hold the value either True or False.  

Example:
x = 10 		& 	y = 5   
print(x > y) # True  
print(x == y) # False  
print(y < 20) # True 


Terminal & CLI (Command Line Interface)
The Terminal (or CLI - Command Line Interface) is a text-based interface used to interact with the computer. 
It allows users to execute commands, manage files, and run programs.  

Few commands i picked up on internet while learning about CLI.  

ls        # List files and directories
pwd       # Print current directory
cd /path  # Change directory
mkdir new_folder  # Create a new directory
rm file.txt  # Remove a file  

Text editor.
A text editor is a application used to create, edit, and manipulate plain text files.

 Text editors range from simple ones like Notepad to advanced editors for coding like VS Code, Jetbrains Pycharm and Vim.

VIM Text editor. 
- it is inbuilt on macOS , as MacOS is built on top of Linux.

Steps to use vim text editor :-

Open Terminal: Launch the Terminal application on your Mac.

Navigate to directory: Use the cd command to move to the folder where you want to create the text file.
Example: cd Desktop to go to your Desktop folder.

Create the file:
Type:- vim filename.txt

Press Enter.
This will open a new empty file named "filename.txt" in Vim. 

Editing the file:
Enter insert mode: Press the "i" key to start typing text.  
Write your text: Type the content you want in the file.
Exit insert mode: Press the "Esc" key to go back to normal mode. 

Saving and exiting:
Save: Press "Esc" followed by ":w" and then "Enter" to save the file.
Quit: Press "Esc" followed by ":q" and then "Enter" to exit Vim.  
or Combine Save & Quit - “ :wq “

We learnt to use vim on terminal & upload our text files to github.  
we started by installing Git on our computers and Uploading our files, by following the steps.  
1. Download git from git-scm.com/ downloads. 
2. Install on device. 
3. Create a repository on get up named internship. 
4. Create a file from your terminal. 
5. Edit file. 
6. Initialise from the same folder. 
7. Add the text file created. 
8. Commit the file with a message. 
9. Push the file.  

We used the following commands.
git init git add internD1.txt
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M master
git remote add origin https://github.com/marky116x/Intership.git
git push -u origin master
