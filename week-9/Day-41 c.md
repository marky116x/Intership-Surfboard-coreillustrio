### Firebase and Angular  Report

&#x20;Today i learnt  and gained a basic understanding of Firebase and the different builds and tools it offers. \
\
I learned how Firebase can be used not only for backend services like authentication and database management but also for deployment and hosting. I focused particularly on Firebase Authentication and Firestore Database during this learning period.

To created a practice project, I built a simple to-do list application using Angular and Firebase. The app allows users to register, log in, and securely manage their personal to-do items. I integrated **Firebase Authentication** to handle user sign-up and login processes, ensuring that each user's data remains private and protected. The tasks are stored and retrieved using **Firestore**, which enabled  seamless data updates.

This project helped me understand the  application of Angular with Firebase a *(Baas)* **Backend-as-a-service** platform  . \
\
I also became more stronger working with Angular components, services, and reactive forms, while gaining hands-on experience with Firebase configuration, Firestore operations , and authentication flows.

Overall, building this app helped me connect  learning with actual implementation, and gave me a stronger foundation in both Angular and Firebase
