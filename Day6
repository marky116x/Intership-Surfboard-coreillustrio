Introduction.

#Mathematical representations.

Lets consider two statements p & q.

1. Logical Conjunction (AND) p∧q - True if both p & q are true, otherwise false.
2. Logical Disjunction (OR)  p∨q - True if at least one of p & q are true
3. Negation (NOT)            ¬p  - Reverses the truth value of The statement. If p is true, ¬p is false, and vice versa.
4. Implication (Conditional) p→q - one thing happen , then another thing follows.
5. Biconditional(If and Only If) p↔q - True if both p&q have the same truth value (both true or both false).
                                      If & only If p is true then only q can be true also.

Here’s the mathematical representation for each of the logical operations:

1. Logical Conjunction (AND) 
   - Truth Table:
     | p | q |p∧q|
     |---|---|---|
     | T | T | T |
     | T | F | F |
     | F | T | F |
     | F | F | F |

2. Logical Disjunction (OR)

   - Truth Table:
     | p | q |p∨q|
     |---|---|---|
     | T | T | T |
     | T | F | T |
     | F | T | T |
     | F | F | F |

3. Negation (NOT)

   - Truth Table:
     | p | ¬p|
     |---|---|
     | T | F |
     | F | T |

4. Implication (Conditional)
   
   - Truth Table:
     | p | q |p→q|
     |---|---|---|
     | T | T | T |
     | T | F | F |
     | F | T | T |
     | F | F | T |

5.Biconditional (If and Only If)
  
   - Truth Table:
     | p | q |p↔q|
     |---|---|---|
     | T | T | T |
     | T | F | F |
     | F | T | F |
     | F | F | T |

Mark down file.
Markdown (.md) is a lightweight markup language used to format text in a simple and readable way. 
It is commonly used for documentation, READ.ME files on GitHub, and writing structured content.

We discussed how development works at Surfboard, where Flutter and JavaScript are the primary technologies used.

How AI Enhances Surfboard Apps.?
AI in surfboard apps personalizes the user experience by analyzing behavior and preferences.

->Recommendation based on previous purchases. 
ex. Mark goes to a clothing store and buys Light weighted , airy shirts. 
Using this information Ai can translate; and show on screen Light weighted & airy dresses similar to Previous purchase. 
- Material used, design (Lots of holes for design  or thinness of cloth), structure.
and recommend alternative designs which have the same charasterics . 

->Ads based on previous purchases.  ex. New launch of Light and Airy Jackets or Pullover. Shorts which are Light weight and follow the same kind of design 
 personalised messages and holiday wishes. which can be automated through AI.
    		 ex. If mark buys cloths which has Marvel & its characters branding,
		AI can take note of it and message them When a new movie or Series is released & Run Ad on screen based on latest release new movie or Series.

Which can increase profits & make an memorable experience for the customer.  
       
Flutter AI Integration.
Enhance Flutter apps with AI for image recognition, NLP, and predictive analytics.  
:- Image recognition -Amazon camera.
:- NLP -  Predictive text, wrong grammar correction on pos.
:- Predictive analytics - What we spoke over top (How AI Enhances Surfboard Apps.). 

Key AI Tools, examples.
TensorFlow Lite -Multi-platform Support for Android and iOS , MacOS & Linux - supports. -Choose TensorFlow if you are focused on deploying models at scale, 
need extensive production support, or prefer a more established ecosystem.

PyTorch Mobile -Supports only Mobile applications. -Choose PyTorch if you prioritize ease of use, flexibility, and a dynamic approach to model building, especially in research or prototyping contexts.
Conclusion : For surfboard , since the user-base is huge and Need cross platform support and only mobile support, we would choose TensorFlow For production ready deployable applications.


4. Vertex AI.   latest Gemini models from Google.
 Vertex AI is a machine learning (ML) platform that helps you build, deploy, and manage AI models.  
With Vertex AI, you can use and customize large language models (LLMs). 
Prediction is the end goal, Vertex ai gives tools to support for ML workflow.  
Managed Datasets + (AutoML) models => Prediction.   

Conclusion.
Today we had a conversation about how to think and brainstorm ideas to be a better.
And not a rely on Ai but to review doc files on particular techology and gain insites from diffrent resources,
to have a broader perspective, instead of having all compessed in one place through AI.

we followed by study on how to use Ai in Flutter development.
