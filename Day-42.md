Today I  refreshed all Angular topics I  learned so far. I revisited and practiced key concepts to strengthen my understanding  of Angular.

Topics Revisited:

Angular fundamentals and component structure

Data binding (interpolation, property, event, and two-way binding)

Lifecycle hooks and component interaction @input & @output

Angular forms and pipes

Hands-on Practice:

Practiced component communication using `@Input()` and `@Output()`  to pass data between parent and child components.

I made a Personal Information Form using Angular's template-driven approach. 

On form submission, captured the entered personal details and displayed them below the form.

Used the **pipe** to format and display the data below the form when submitted.

Improve the UI and UX of the form using Tailwind CSS.

Used reactive forms .
